# derma.ai
This project is build for odooXcharusat Hackathon 2025.

## Overview
AI-powered Skin Disease Detection Platform—a web app allowing users to upload images for instant AI-based diagnosis, personalized treatment plans, nearby hospital/dermatologist 
recommendations, appointment booking, and homemade or Ayurvedic remedies. It includes telemedicine services, an online medicine marketplace, progress tracking, health insights, and a reward wallet for engagement. 

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload skin images for analysis.
- **AI Prediction**: ML model classifies the disease and provides homemade remedies.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.
- **Result History**: Users can view their past diagnoses.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with React for a smooth user experience.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
- **Deployment**: Render

## How It Works
1. **Upload Image** → User uploads a skin image.
2. **ML Model Prediction** → The image is analyzed, and the model predicts the disease.
3. **Display remedies** → Homemade remedies are displayed.
4. **Save to History** → The result is stored for future reference.

## Future Improvements
- Improve model accuracy with a larger dataset.
- Add a chatbot for health recommendations.
- Enable API access for third-party integrations.
